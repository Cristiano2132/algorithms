Certainly! Here's the added topic about finding the index of an element for tuple, list, and array:

## Tuple

### 1. How to create an object

```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

### 2. How to add an element

```python
# Adding an element to a tuple is not possible since tuples are immutable
```

### 3. How to remove an element

```python
# Removing an element from a tuple is not possible since tuples are immutable
```

### 4. How to select an element

```python
# Selecting an element from a tuple
element = my_tuple[0]
```

### 5. How to reorder elements

```python
# Reordering elements in a tuple is not possible since tuples are immutable
```

### 6. How to find the index of an element

To find the index of an element in a tuple, you can use the `index()` method:

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 30)
element_to_find = 30
index = my_tuple.index(element_to_find)
print("Index of", element_to_find, "is", index)
```


## List

### 1. How to create an object

```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

### 2. How to add an element

```python
# Adding an element to a list
my_list.append(4)
```

### 3. How to remove an element

```python
# Removing an element from a list
my_list.remove(2)
```

### 4. How to select an element

```python
# Selecting an element from a list
element = my_list[0]
```

### 5. How to reorder elements

```python
# Reordering elements in a list
my_list.sort()
```

### 6. How to find the index of an element

To find the index of an element in a list, you can use the `index()` method:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30]
element_to_find = 30
index = my_list.index(element_to_find)
print("Index of", element_to_find, "is", index)
```


## NumPy ndarray (Array)

### 1. How to create an object

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

### 2. How to add an element

```python
# Adding an element to a NumPy array
my_array = np.append(my_array, 4)
```

### 3. How to remove an element

```python
# Removing an element from a NumPy array
# NumPy arrays are fixed in size, so removing an element involves creating a new array without the element
my_array = np.delete(my_array, 1)  # Example: Removing the element at index 1
```

### 4. How to select an element

```python
# Selecting an element from a NumPy array
element = my_array[0]
```

### 5. How to reorder elements

```python
# Reordering elements in a NumPy array
my_array.sort()
```

### 6. How to find the index of an element

To find the index of an element in a NumPy array, you can use the `where()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 30])
element_to_find = 30
indices = np.where(my_array == element_to_find)[0]
print("Indices of", element_to_find, "are", indices)
```

## NumPy Multidimensional ndarray (Array)

### 1. How to create an object:

To create a multidimensional NumPy array, you can pass a nested list or tuple to the `np.array()` function. Each inner list or tuple represents a row in the array.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D NumPy array (3x3 matrix)
my_2d_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

### 2. How to add an element:

Adding an element to a specific position in a multidimensional array involves specifying the indices.

```python
# Adding an element to a specific position in a 2D NumPy array
my_2d_array[1, 1] = 10  # Set the element at row 1, column 1 to 10
```

### 3. How to remove an element:

Removing an element from a multidimensional array can be done by creating a new array without the unwanted element.

```python
# Removing a row from a 2D NumPy array
my_2d_array = np.delete(my_2d_array, 1, axis=0)  # Remove the row at index 1
```

### 4. How to select an element:

Selecting an element in a multidimensional array involves specifying the indices.

```python
# Selecting an element from a 2D NumPy array
element = my_2d_array[0, 1]  # Get the element at row 0, column 1
```

### 5. How to reorder elements:

Reordering elements in a multidimensional array can be done by sorting along a specified axis.

```python
# Reordering elements in a 2D NumPy array along rows (axis=0)
my_2d_array.sort(axis=0)
```

Certainly! Let's discuss both search and sorting algorithms, how they work, their complexity, and how to implement them in Python.

## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. **Linear Sort (Selection Sort)**

- **How it works:** Linear sort, also known as selection sort, works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

- **Complexity (Time):** O(n^2) in the average and worst cases, where n is the number of elements.

- **Implementation in Python:**
  
  ```python
  def linear_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          min_idx = i
          for j in range(i + 1, n):
              if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                  min_idx = j
          arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
      return arr
  ```

### 2. **Quicksort**

- **How it works:** Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is then repeated for each sub-array.

- **Complexity (Time):** Average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n), worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).

- **Implementation in Python:**
  
  ```python
  def quicksort(arr):
      if len(arr) <= 1:
          return arr
      pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
      left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
      middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
      right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
      return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
  ```

### 3. **Bubble Sort**

- **How it works:** Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

- **Complexity (Time):** O(n^2) in the average and worst cases.

- **Implementation in Python:**
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  ```

### 4. **Pivot Sort (Insertion Sort)**

- **How it works:** Pivot sort, also known as insertion sort, builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position.

- **Complexity (Time):** O(n^2) in the average and worst cases.

- **Implementation in Python:**
  
  ```python
  def pivot_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(1, n):
          key = arr[i]
          j = i-1
          while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
              arr[j+1] = arr[j]
              j -= 1
          arr[j+1] = key
      return arr
  ```

## Searching Algorithms

### 1. **Linear Search**

- **How it works:** Linear search, also known as sequential search, checks each element of the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.

- **Complexity (Time):** O(n) in the worst case.

- **Implementation in Python:**
  
  ```python
  def linear_search(arr, target):
      for i in range(len(arr)):
          if arr[i] == target:
              return i  # Return the index if found
      return -1  # Return -1 if not found
  ```

### 2. **Binary Search**

- **How it works:** Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and continues the search in the lower or upper half, depending on the comparison.

- **Complexity (Time):** O(log n) in the worst case.

- **Implementation in Python:**
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = left + (right - left) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid  # Return the index if found
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1  # Return -1 if not found
  ```
